I have run the Jenkins pipeline, got lot of issues with pipeline. I have done troubleshootings with volumes, versions 

Jenkins is trying to run Docker CLI commands, but docker is not available inside that container.

Even though you switched agent any for the Docker stage, because you're in a script block and used sh, itâ€™s possibly executing within the original container context.

Sonarqube is running good.
